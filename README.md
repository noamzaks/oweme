# Owe Me
Paying for pizza. Together.

## Introduction
This project was created for UB Hacking 2020.
We created OweMe to make group payments easier and keep track of debts. As teenagers, we are used to buying things together.
Take for example the usual scenario: we're hungry. We want some pizza!
The only problem is "splitting the cheque". Many times we split half-half with someone, but when it's a group of 7 people for example and everyone has their own set of coins - it becomes almost impossible to split.

This is where OweMe comes in.
